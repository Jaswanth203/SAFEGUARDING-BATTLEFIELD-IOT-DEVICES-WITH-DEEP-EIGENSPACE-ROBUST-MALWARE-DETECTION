Internet of Things (IoT) in military settings generally consists of a diverse range of Internet-connected devices and nodes (e.g. medical devices and wearable combat uniforms). 
These IoT devices and nodes are a valuable target for cyber criminals, particularly state-sponsored or nation state actors. A common attack vector is the use of malware.
In this paper, we present a deep learning-based method to detect Internet Of Battlefield Things (IoBT) malware via the deviceâ€™s Operational Code (OpCode) sequence.
We transmute OpCodes into a vector space and apply a deep Eigenspace learning approach to classify malicious and benign applications.
We also demonstrate the robustness of our proposed approach in malware detection and its sustainability against junk code insertion attacks. Lastly, we make available our malware sample on GitHub, which hopefully will benefit future research efforts (e.g. to facilitate evaluation of future malware detection approaches).
In conclusion, our deep learning-based method offers a promising solution to the pressing challenge of detecting IoBT malware, providing enhanced security measures for military IoT environments.
By transmuting OpCodes into a vector space and leveraging deep Eigenspace learning, we achieve accurate classification of malicious and benign applications, thereby fortifying defense mechanisms against cyber threats.
Moreover, our approach demonstrates remarkable resilience against sophisticated attacks, including junk code insertion, ensuring sustained effectiveness in dynamic operational settings. 
Through the release of our malware samples on Github, we aim to foster collaboration and innovation in the ongoing pursuit of advancing malware detection techniques for military IoT ecosystems. 
This contribution underscores our commitment to bolstering cybersecurity efforts and safeguarding critical infrastructure in the face of evolving threats.
